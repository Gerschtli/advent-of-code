# Advent of Code

Yes, it's christmas time, my friends!

These are my solutions to the [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## How to run

You need go 1.15 and rustup (with a recent rust version) installed or use my `shell.nix`.

### Go applications

Can be run like:
```sh
cd 2020/01
go run ./main.go
```

### Rust applications

Can be run like:
```sh
cd 2020/02
cargo run
```
